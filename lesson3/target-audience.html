                    Jack has been driving close to an hour each way to find clients that he is familiar with so 
                    he can continue to make money and support his family. His new neighbors are so far away that he does 
                    not feel comfortable approaching them or knocking on their door. He is tired of all the driving and 
                    not getting to spend enough time with his family. He wants to find jobs closer to home and is looking to 
                    network with his fellow small business owners in the area. He is looking for resources to meet his neighbors 
                    and find work closer to his new home.

                She loves to grow all types of plants and has recently been gardening for a lot of her own produce.<br>
                She enjoys:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hosting family dinners and making delicious food from plants she grew herself</li>

            <h4>Environment:</h4>
            <p>
                Jean has been widowed for almost a decade and lives in a house by herself in a very remote area. 
                She has always had a green thumb and uses a lot of her property for gardening. She does not get to interact 
                with a lot of people on a regular basis, unless her children are visiting
            </p>
            <h3>Scenarios:</h3>
            <ul class="more-spacing-bottom">
                <li>
                    Jean has been growing a lot of her own food for a long time and loves to garden. 
                    It is one of the few things that keep her active but she has been wasting a lot of 
                    her home grown produce recently because she is cultivating more than she can eat by 
                    herself. She has been thinking about selling some of her produce but isn't sure where 
                    to start. She is retired and isn't looking for a full time job but could use a little bit 
                    more money each month. She wonders if any of her neighbors would be interested in buying her 
                    extra produce and is looking for a way to get to know them and interact with them on a more regular basis
